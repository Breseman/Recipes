# Potato Leek Soup
3+ hrs simmering | a great deal of soup

## Ingredients
* 4-5 leeks
* cube of butter
* 7-8 good size red potatoes
* bag of cut corn
* (meat- bacon, cooked clams, smoked salmon)

## Directions
Wash leeks, cut off ends and tough ends of tops; cut leeks into small pieces. Use a knife on the white bottom part and scissors for the greens. Sauté in butter.

Cut potatoes into small pieces so they cook down well. Stir into leeks so that both potatoes and leeks are covered with butter.

Add enough water to cover the vegetables and maybe an inch or two more to allow it to cook down.

Simmer for at least an hour. Try not to add water during the cooking process, as you will lose flavor. Stir occasionally.

After the potatoes have become somewhat soft (1-1 ½ hrs) add a full bag of cut corn. Simmer another hour.

Add cooked chunks of meat.

Better the next day.
