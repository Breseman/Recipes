# Lemon Bars

## Ingredients
### Crust
¾ cup flour
3 Tbsp sugar
4 Tbsp butter

### Topping
2 eggs
2/3 cup sugar
2 Tbsp flour
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1 Tbsp water
¼ tsp baking powder
1 tsp lemon zest

## Directions
Preheat oven to 350 F.

In a small bowl, combine the ¾ cup flour and 3 Tbsp sugar. Cut in the butter until crumbly.

Grease an 8x8” baking pan, and pat flour mixture into it. Bake for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, beat eggs with an electric mixer until frothy. Add the 2/3 cups sugar, 2 Tbsp flour, lemon juice, water, and baking powder and beat on medium speed for three minutes, or until slightly thickened. Stir in lemon peel.

Pour lemon mixture over just-baked crust. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the edges begin to brown and the center has set.
