# Sour Cream Snowflakes
375° | 30mins prep | 1hr chill | 7mins baking | 48 cookies

## Ingredients
* ½ cup butter
* ½ cup shortening
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* ¾ teaspoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 1/3 cup dairy sour cream
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* 1/3 cup raspberry jam
* Sifted powdered sugar

## Directions
In a large mixing bowl beat butter and shortening with an electric mixer on med-high speed for 30 seconds. Add granulated sugar, baking powder, and baking soda. Beat until combined. Beat in the sour cream, egg, and vanilla. Beat in as much of the flour. Halve dough. Cover and chill in refrigerator 1-2 hrs or until easy to handle.

On a lightly floured surface, roll ½ the dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Using a 2 ½ -inch star-shaped cookie cutter, cut into stars. Cut a small star shape from the center of half of the stars. Place cookies on ungreased cookie sheet.

Bake cookies in a 375F oven 7-8 minutes, or until edges are firm and bottoms are very lightly browned. Transfer cookies to wire rack; cool.

Spread the center of half of the cookies with jam, using about ¼ teaspoon of jam on each. Place a cookie on top, offsetting the points of the top and bottom cookies. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.
