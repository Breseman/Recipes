# Salt Water Taffy

# Ingredients
* 1 c sugar
* ¾ c corn syrup
* 2/3 c water
* 1 T corn starch
* 2 T margarine
* 1 t salt
* 2 t vanilla (or another flavoring)

# Directions
Butter a square pan.

In a 2 quart saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, water, corn starch, margarine, and salt.

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, to 256° on a candy thermometer or until a small amount of the mixture dropped in very cold water forms a hard ball.

Remove from heat, stir in vanilla.

Pour into pan.

When just cool enough to handle, butter hands and pull taffy until satiny and light in color and stiff.

Pull into long strips, ½” wide. With scissors, cut strips into 1” pieces. Wrap in waxed paper.
