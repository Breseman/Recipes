# Huckleberry Muffins

## Ingredients
* 2 cups flour
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 cups huckleberries
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup milk or cream
* 2/3 cup sugar or packed brown sugar
* 4-8 tablespoons melted butter
* 1 teaspoon vanilla

## Directions
Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Grease a standard 12-muffin pan or line with paper cups.

Thoroughly mix the flour, baking powder, salt and huckleberries together in a large bowl. Set aside.

In another bowl, whisk together eggs, milk or cream, sugar, butter, and vanilla.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix together with a few light strokes just until just blended. Do not overmix; the batter should not be smooth.

Divide the batter among the muffin cups.

Bake for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in 1 or 2 of the muffins comes out clean.
