# Ricotta Cheesecake
1 cake | 350F | pre-refrigerate springform pan | 1 hour cook | 5 hour/overnight cooling

## Ingredients
### Crust
* 2 cups graham crackers (crushed)
* ¼ cup melted butter
* ¼ cup sugar

### Filling
* 16 oz. (2 bricks) cream cheese
* 16 oz. ricotta cheese
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 3 eggs
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* ½ lemon squeezed (¼ c. juice)

### Topping
* 1 pint sour cream
* 2 Tbs. sugar
* ½ lemon squeezed
* ½ tsp. vanilla

## Directions
Preheat oven to 350° F.

Mix graham crackers, butter, and sugar together. Press into a refrigerated springform pan. Line outside with foil to catch butter leaks.

Beat eggs well with electric mixer. Add cream cheese, ricotta, sugar, lemon and vanilla together until all lumps are gone. Pour into crust. Cook for 1 hour with a pan of water on rack below for moist cooking (keeps crust from cracking).

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix sour cream, sugar, and lemon juice together.

Remove cake from oven, and add topping. Cook for five more minutes.

Let cake chill 5 hours or overnight. Garnish with fresh berries.
