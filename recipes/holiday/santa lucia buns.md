# Santa Lucia Buns
350 | 20 mins | 36 buns

## Ingredients
* ½ c warm water (about 110˚)
* ¾ c soft butter
* 7 c flour
* 2 T active dry yeast
* 1 c sugar
* ¾ t salt
* ¼ t saffron (or 1½ t ground cardamom & 1 t grated orange peel)
* 1 egg

### Topping
* ½ c dark raisins or currants
* 2 egg yolks mixed with 1½ T water

## Directions
Combine warm water and soft butter. Add yeast.

Mix flour, sugar, salt, saffron (or cardamom/orange substitute); add to water/butter/yeast mixture.

Add egg, beat again.

Add a cup at a time up to 5½ c flour until it forms a very stiff dough. Knead until smooth & elastic (10 min).

Put dough in a greased bowl, turn over to grease top, cover & let rise in a warm place until double (1 hr).

Punch down dough, turn out onto a lightly floured board, knead lightly again.

Pinch off balls of dough about 1½” in diameter, roll each into a smooth rope about 12” long.

Coil ends opposite ways to form an S shape. Decorate curl with a raisin in the center of each coil.

Cover and let rise in a warm place 25 minutes.

Brush evenly with yolk-water mixture for golden tops.

Bake 20 minutes at 350F.
