# Buttermilk Biscuits
450 degrees | 10-12 mins baking | 20 2” biscuits

## Ingredients
* 2 c flour
* 2½ t baking powder
* ½ to ¾ t salt
* 5-6 T cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces
* ¾ c milk

## Directions
Position a rack in the center of the oven; preheat. Have ready a large ungreased baking sheet.

Whisk together thoroughly in a large bowl: flour, baking powder, salt. Drop in butter; cut in. Do not allow the butter to melt or form a paste with the flour.

Add milk all at once. Mix just until most of the dry ingredients are moistened. With a lightly floured hand, gather the dough into a ball and knead it gently against the sides and bottom of the bowl 5 to 10 times, turning and pressing any loose pieces into the dough each time until they adhere and the bowl is fairly clean.

Transfer to a lightly floured surface, roll with a lightly floured rolling pin to ½” thick. Cut rounds, bake.
