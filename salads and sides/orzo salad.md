## Ingredients

### Orzo Salad
* 1 cup walnut halves
* 1 cucumber
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1 yellow bell pepper
* 1 1/2 cups dry orzo pasta
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/2 cup diced scallion
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
* 1 1/4 cups crumbled feta cheese
* salt & freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Lemon Vinaigrette
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
* 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
* 1 garlic clove, finely chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

## Directions
Fill a large saucepan two-thirds full of water. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil.

Drop in the pasta and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or until tender.

Remove the pan from the heat and drain the pasta in a colander, then cool the pasta by running cold tap water over the colander for a few minutes.

Shake the colander to remove excess water and transfer the cooled pasta to a medium bowl.

Toss with the olive oil to keep the pasta from sticking together.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast on the center rack of the oven for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown.

Let cool, then coarsely chop and mix with pasta

Peel and core the cucumber and cut it into 1/2-inch cubes.

Core the red and yellow peppers and cut them into 1/2-inch-square pieces.

Set aside.

Add the cucumbers, peppers, scallions, basil, parsley and feta.

Drizzle in the Lemon Vinaigrette and toss well.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.

### Lemon Vinaigrette
Combine all the ingredients except the olive oil in a medium bowl. Mix well with a whisk. Add the oil in a slow stream, whisking as you pour. Continue whisking until the dressing has emulsified, then cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
