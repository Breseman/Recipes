Once the mixture has cooled and the butter has melted, add to KitchenAid bowl.

Add flour and knead (using dough hook) until the dough comes together.

Add the eggs one at a time and continue kneading until dough is smooth and elastic (5-10 minutes).

Punch down dough, let rise for 45 more minutes.

Turn out onto a lightly floured board, knead lightly again.

Pinch off balls of dough about 1½” in diameter, roll each into a smooth rope about 12” long.
